        <p>
          <strong>Social IT</strong> was founded in <strong>2024</strong> with a
          simple idea: to create a space where people can easily connect, share
          their stories, and discover new perspectives. What started as a small
          project has grown into a thriving community of users who inspire us
          every day.
